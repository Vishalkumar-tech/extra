Ratings continues to factor in JKTI’s established position in the domestic tyre industry<br>characterised by strong market position in the TBR segment and growing presence in the passenger tyre segment, and its wide<br>marketing and distribution network.<br>The ratings further factors in slight moderation in operating margins in 9MFY25 (refers to April 01 to Dec 31), on a consolidated<br>level the company has earned revenue of ₹10,992 crore with operating margin of 11.8% as against 13.5% in FY24. The<br>moderation in profitability margins in 9MFY25 is in line with Care expectations with increase in raw material costs. Though the<br>margins are expected to remain constraint in the near term but in the medium-term profitability margins shall remain comfortable,<br>and range bound as JKTI is focussing on increasing the premium portfolio, which shall contribute more to profitability going<br>forward. Debt levels are expected to peak in FY26, as the planned truck and bus radial (TBR), passenger car radial (PCR), and all<br>steel light truck radial (ASLTR) capacity expansion is expected to be completed by FY26-end.<br>However, ratings continue to be constrained by raw material price volatility, which may dent operating margins in the near term,<br>exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks, and competitive industry. Cost overruns in the announced capacity expansion plans<br>by JKTI, delays in deriving likely benefits, and/or a sharp rise in the RM prices significantly impacting margins and increase in its<br>net leverage position could lead to deterioration in credit metrics and they remain a key monitorable.<br>CARE Ratings further considers approval by the board of JKTI regarding the recent scheme of amalgamation with Cavendish<br>Industries Limited (CIL, rated CARE A+ / CARE A1 (Rating Watch with Positive Implications)), and notes that there is no impact<br>from it on JKTI’s credit profile as the analytical approach followed for JKTI is consolidated, which includes CIL being a subsidiary<br>of JKTI.<br>Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions<br>Positive factors<br>• Increasing its scale of operations and enhancing its market share and improving PBILDT margins over 15% on a sustained<br>basis.<br>• Improving capital structure and net leverage such that net total debt (including acceptances and dealer deposits) to PBILDT<br>is below 2x on a sustained basis.<br>Negative factors<br>• Declining profitability as marked by PBILDT margin below 10% on a sustained basis.<br>• Increasing debt (other than envisaged) due to capex or higher working capital requirement leading to deteriorating net total<br>debt (including acceptances and dealer deposits) to PBILDT of over 3x on a sustained basis.<br>1Complete definition of ratings assigned are available at www.careedge.in and other CARE Ratings Limited’s publications.<br>1 CARE Ratings Ltd.</p><h2>Page 2</h2><p>Press Release<br>Analytical approach: Consolidated<br>Owing to strong operational and strategic linkages with its subsidiaries (CIL and JK Tornel S. A. De. CV). These entities are in the<br>same line of business, sell under common brands, and have common management and control. Consolidated entities considered<br>are listed under Annexure-6.<br>Outlook: Stable<br>Stable outlook for JKTI reflects its likelihood to maintain its market position, healthy operating performance, and financial risk<br>profile over the medium term.<br>Detailed description of key rating drivers:<br>Key strengths<br>Stable volume levels and increased scale of operations likely to sustain in medium term<br>Subsequent to robust demand for passenger vehicles (PVs) and commercial vehicles (CVs) in FY24, the company’s demand<br>remained flat in 9MFY25. At consolidated levels, sales volume for PLR and non-truck bias witnessed growth of 5% and 2%<br>respectively, while 2-3 wheelers and TBB reported volumes decline of 10% and 7%, respectively, which is in line with automobile<br>industry. The sales volumes of TBR remained flat in 9MFY25.<br>JKTI ranks among the first four domestic tyre manufacturing companies based on overall revenue share and has presence across<br>majority tyre segments. CARE Ratings notes that JKTI is a market leader in the truck and bus tyre segment and is gaining market<br>share in PCR tyre segment.<br>The company’s performance improved in the last few years, including FY24, with the revenue jumped by 2% Y-o-Y, respectively.<br>During 9MFY25, revenue marginally declined by 3% y-o-y to ₹10,992 crore with overall capacity utilisation was at ~80% on a<br>consolidated level (as against ~83% in 9MFY24), JK Tyre was standalone at 85% (~92% in 9MFY24), CIL was at 74% (~76% in<br>9MFY24) and JK Tornel S. A. De. CV. was at 75% (~73% in 9MFY24).<br>Owing to high utilisation levels of the current capacities, JKTI has announced capex in the next 2-3 years in TBR and PCR side to<br>be able to maintain their market share and scale up its operations. Capex on the PCR side is on higher rim sizes, which will be<br>margin accretive as JKTI historically had a sales mix skewed towards a lower rim size in PCR and less premium products and used<br>to have lower operating margins compared to peers in the industry. JKTI is now actively working to bridge the gap and move<br>towards the premium portfolio offering.<br>CARE Ratings expects the emerging demand scenario from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to be comfortable in the PV<br>segment and remain flat to low in the CV segment. However, demand is expected to be healthy in the replacement market of<br>PVs and CVs. Going forward, growth is expected from higher government infrastructure spending and increased vehicle<br>penetration due to last mile connectivity emanating from improved economic outlook.<br>Improvement in operating profitability in FY24, though some moderation in 9MFY25 owing to higher input costs<br>Natural rubber prices, which forms one-third of the total raw material cost, is on the rising trend in 9MFY25. PBILDT margin<br>moderated to 11.77% in 9MFY25 from 14.34% in 9MFY24 owing to the current volatile input prices scenario. CARE Ratings<br>expects operating profit margin to remain moderate for FY25 considering the current volatile input prices scenario; however, it is<br>expected to benefit from operating leverage and continuous efforts of the management towards portfolio premiumisation. CARE<br>Ratings continues to monitor RM price volatility and JKTI’s ability to sustain/improve its operating margins amid rising RM prices<br>and its ability to pass them on as price hikes.<br>Improved leverage and coverage indicators<br>CARE Ratings notes that in FY24, the company’s leverage and solvency indicators have improved owing to its improved<br>profitability, reduction in term debt, and issuance of equity through qualified institutional placement (QIP) worth ₹500 crore in<br>December 2023.<br>The company’s consolidated gross debt (including LC acceptances and dealer deposits) reduced from ₹5,876 crore as on March<br>31, 2023 to ₹5,567 crore as on March 31, 2024. Reduction is mainly due to reduction in long-term debt to the extent of ₹151<br>crore. Overall gearing (including LC acceptance and dealer deposits) improved from 1.81x as on March 31, 2023, to 1.28x as on<br>2 CARE Ratings Ltd.</p><h2>Page 3</h2><p>Press Release<br>March 31, 2024. Interest coverage has improved from 2.94x in FY23 to 4.75x in FY24 and is expected to remain ~4x even with<br>slight moderation as expected in operating profitability going forward.<br>The net total debt (including LC acceptance and dealer deposits) to PBILDT ratio improved to 2.27x for FY24 as compared to<br>4.21x in FY23. CARE Ratings understands that the cash available with the company is for the capex purpose and not for debt<br>reduction. This shall be judiciously used over the next two years for capex, reducing the dependence on company’s cash accruals.<br>Consequently, these accruals will be available to manage the company’s working capital needs, decreasing reliance on its working<br>capital utilisation and enhance its coverage indicators.<br>Given the additional capex of ~₹1,400 crore announced in Q3FY23, which is majorly scheduled to be completed in FY26, debt<br>levels are expected to increase in FY25 and FY26 on absolute level by ₹400–500 crore each year. With operating profitability<br>expected to marginally moderate amid RM price volatility scenario, CARE Ratings expects leverage ratios to remain below 3x<br>going forward as well.<br>Delays in implementing projects, higher-than-expected debt, substantial increase in RM prices, and increased competition from<br>imports or cost overruns shall adversely affect the company’s leverage/credit profile and shall remain a key monitorable.<br>Diversified product portfolio and wide distribution network<br>In 9MFY25, JKTI’s customer-wise revenue mix on a consolidated basis is OEM to replacement to export ratio at 21%:62%:17%,<br>respectively (FY24- 23%:61%:16%). Exports were subdued in FY24 due to geo-political conditions, which improved to some<br>extent in 9MFY25. Demand from replacement markets is also expected to remain healthy in FY25, on the OEM side, while PV is<br>expected to be stable, but demand from CV segment shall remain moderate in current year. Segment-wise revenue mix for truck<br>and bus bias /radial, passenger line radial, 2W&3W, and others stood at 54%, 29%, 4%, and 13%, respectively, in FY24 and at<br>52%, 31%, 4%, and 13%, respectively in 9MFY25. The company’s focus on increasing share in the PCR tyre market and strong<br>demand experienced in the PCR segment is also reflected in sales mix, with PCR segment experiencing significant increase in<br>sales mix. The contribution of premium tyres increased from 12% in FY19 to 25% in FY24 and is expected to improve to 30-35%<br>over next two years.<br>JKTI has a widespread distribution network across the country with 6000+ dealers and 800+ brand shops. The company is<br>targeting 6500+ dealers and 850+ brand shops in next two years from the present level. It has over 800 exclusive passenger car<br>tyre retail outlets under ‘Steel Wheels & Xpress Wheels’ for small town and semi-urban markets, catering to two-three wheelers<br>as well. It also has 81 JK Tyre truck wheels (fully equipped tyre service centres offering total tyre solutions).<br>Key weaknesses<br>Increased capex intensity in the medium term<br>In Q3FY24, the company further announced the capex of ~₹1,400 crore in TBR, PCR, and ASLTR, which is expected to complete<br>by FY25 and FY26. Targeted debt to equity ratio is 1:1, for which, the company has raised equity through QIP of ₹500 crore. The<br>proceeds will be utilised in phased manner. Considering the past trend, CARE Ratings draws comfort in the management’s capacity<br>to execute the planned projects without increasing the leverage above its targeted levels. Timely completion of the announced<br>projects and JKTI’s ability to draw benefits from the same as envisaged, time and cost overruns, and robust demand to absorb<br>the additional production shall remain key monitorable. Demand-supply mismatch or increased imports from Chinese or otherwise<br>in the country impacting JKTI’s utilisation levels going forward, which may have an impact on its return indicators, shall remain a<br>key monitorable.<br>High competition prevalent in the tyre market<br>The group faces competition from domestic players and Chinese tyre manufacturers. In the past, due to imposition of anti-<br>dumping duty till December 2022 and further imposition of (countervailing duty) anti-subsidy duty in June 2019, competition from<br>Chinese players is mitigated to an extent. In June 2020, the government-imposed curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic<br>tyres used in motor cars, buses, lorries, and motorcycles, in a move to promote domestic manufacturing. Putting goods under<br>restricted category means an importer would require a licence or permission from the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT)<br>for imports. Earlier, import of these tyres was allowed without restrictions.<br>On the domestic front, with removal of anti-dumping duty on Chinese tyres or removal of restrictions on imports, domestic players<br>are expected to face increasing competition. The group continues to face competition from other Indian players. CARE Ratings<br>observes that the group’s long-standing relationships with OEMs helps mitigate competition to an extent.<br>3 CARE Ratings Ltd.</p><h2>Page 4</h2><p>Press Release<br>Exposure to exchange rate movement and RM price volatility<br>RMs constitute ~ 60%-65% of the total operating income (TOI). Rubber and crude oil are global commodities and prices vary<br>across international markets. The tyre business is highly sensitive to movement in rubber and crude oil prices, and in the past,<br>PBILDT margins have been fluctuating from 8-15% from FY15 to FY24.<br>JKTI is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation risks, as it has significant export income and import payments for RM requirements<br>(which are ~35-40% imported), apart from having foreign currency loans (FCLs). While FCLs of CIL are fully hedged, JKTI’s FCLs<br>are not, which exposes it to foreign exchange fluctuation risk. However, natural hedge in its business enables to partially mitigate<br>the risk. The company’s margins are highly susceptible to foreign exchange volatility.

Most entities whose bank facilities/instruments are rated by CARE Ratings have paid a credit rating fee,<br>based on the amount and type of bank facilities/instruments. CARE Ratings or its subsidiaries/associates may also be involved with other commercial transactions with<br>the entity.
